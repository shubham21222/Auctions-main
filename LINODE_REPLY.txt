Subject: Response to Abuse Report - High Resource Usage / Traffic Alert

Dear Linode Trust & Safety Team,

I am writing regarding the recent abuse report/alert concerning high traffic and resource usage on my server.

Upon investigation, I identified that the high traffic and CPU usage were caused by a misconfiguration in my application's code, specifically within the public `/filter` API endpoint.

**Root Cause:**
1. The API endpoint lacked a maximum limit on pagination (e.g., `?limit=10000` was allowed), which caused heavy database queries and excessive data transfer.
2. There was no rate limiting in place, allowing external bots/scrapers to hit this expensive endpoint repeatedly, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) like scenario.
3. This was NOT an intentional attack launched by my server, but rather my server being overwhelmed by external requests due to these missing safeguards.

**Remedial Actions Taken:**
1. **Code Patch Implemented:** I have deployed a fix that enforces a strict maximum limit (capped at 50 items) on the API, regardless of the requested value.
2. **Rate Limiting Configured:** I have implemented global and route-specific rate limiting to block abusive IP addresses automatically.
3. **Security Hardening:** I am reviewing server logs for any other signs of compromise and have rotated all access credentials.

Please consider this ticket resolved as the underlying vulnerability causing the traffic spike has been patched. I am closely monitoring the server to ensure stability.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name/Company]
