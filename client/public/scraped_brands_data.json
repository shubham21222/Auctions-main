            "summary_text": "Louis Vuitton Malletier, commonly known as Louis Vuitton , French: is a French luxury fashion house and company founded in 1854 by Louis Vuitton. The label\u2019s LV monogram appears on most of its products, ranging from luxury bags and leather goods to ready-to-wear, shoes, perfumes, watches, jewellery, accessories, sunglasses and books. Louis Vuitton is one of the world\u2019s leading international fashion houses. It sells its products through standalone boutiques, lease departments in high-end departmental stores, and through the e-commerce section of its website.For six consecutive years (2006\u20132012), Louis Vuitton was named the world\u2019s most valuable luxury brand. Its 2012 valuation was US$25.9 billion. In 2013, the valuation of the brand was US$28.4 billion with revenue of US$9.4 billion. The company operates in 50 countries with more than 460 stores worldwide.",
            "detailed_content": "Founding to World War IIThe Louis Vuitton label was founded by Vuitton in 1854 on Rue Neuve des Capucines in Paris.Louis Vuitton had observed that the HJ Cave Osilite[11] trunk could be easily stacked. In 1858, Vuitton introduced his flat-topped trunks with Trianon canvas, making them lightweight and airtight. Before the introduction of Vuitton\u2019s trunks, rounded-top trunks were used, generally to promote water runoff, and thus could not be stacked. It was Vuitton\u2019s gray Trianon canvas flat trunk that allowed the ability to stack them on top of another with ease for voyages. Many other luggage makers later imitated Vuitton\u2019s style and design.The company participated in the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris. In 1871, \u014cyama Iwao became the first recorded Japanese customer, ordering a set of luggage while in Paris as a military observer during the Franco-Prussian War. To protect against the duplication of his look, Vuitton changed the Trianon design to a beige-and-brown stripes design in 1876. By 1885, the company opened its first store in London on Oxford Street. Soon thereafter, due to the continuing imitation of his look, in 1888, Vuitton created the Damier Canvas pattern, which bore a logo that reads \u201cmarque L. Vuitton d\u00e9pos\u00e9e\u201d, which translates into \u201cL. Vuitton registered trademark\u201d. In 1892, Louis Vuitton died, and the company\u2019s management passed to his son.After the death of his father, Georges Vuitton began a campaign to build the company into a worldwide corporation, exhibiting the company\u2019s products at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair in 1893. In 1896, the company launched the signature Monogram Canvas and made the worldwide patents on it. Its graphic symbols, including quatrefoils and flowers (as well as the LV monogram), were based on the trend of using Japanese Mon designs in the late Victorian era. The patents later proved to be successful in stopping counterfeiting. In this same year, Georges travelled to the United States, where he toured cities such as New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, selling Vuitton products. In 1901, the Louis Vuitton Company introduced the Steamer Bag, a smaller piece of luggage designed to be kept inside Vuitton luggage trunks.WWII Nazi collaborationDuring World War II, Louis Vuitton collaborated with the Nazis during the German occupation of France. The French book Louis Vuitton, A French Saga, authored by French journalist Stephanie Bonvicini and published by Paris-based Editions Fayard, tells how members of the Vuitton family actively aided the Vichy government led by Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain and increased their wealth from their business affairs with the Germans. The family set up a factory dedicated to producing artefacts glorifying P\u00e9tain, including more than 2,500 busts.Caroline Babulle, a spokeswoman for the publisher, Fayard, said: \u201cThey have not contested anything in the book, but they are trying to bury it by pretending it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Responding to the book\u2019s release in 2004, a spokesman for LVMH said: \u201cThis is ancient history. The book covers a period when it was family-run and long before it became part of LVMH. We are diverse, tolerant and all the things a modern company should be.\u201d An LVMH spokesman told the satirical magazine Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9: \u201cWe don\u2019t deny the facts, but regrettably the author has exaggerated the Vichy episode. We haven\u2019t put any pressure on anyone. If the journalists want to censor themselves, then that suits us fine.\u201d That publication was the only French periodical to mention the book, possibly because LVMH is the country\u2019s biggest advertiser in the press.",

            "summary_text": "Patek Philippe SA is a Swiss luxury watch and clock manufacturer, located in the Canton of Geneva and the Vall\u00e9e de Joux.[3] Established in 1839, it is named after two of its founders, Antoni Patek and Adrien Philippe. Since 1932, the company has been owned by the Stern family in Switzerland and remains the last family-owned independent watch manufacturer in Geneva. Patek Philippe is one of the oldest watch manufacturers in the world with an uninterrupted watchmaking history since its founding. It designs and manufactures timepieces as well as movements, including some of the most complicated mechanical watches. The company maintains over 400 retail locations globally and over a dozen distribution centers across Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania. In 2001, it opened the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva.Patek Philippe is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious watch manufacturers in the world. As of July 2023, among the world\u2019s top ten most expensive watches ever sold at auctions, nine are Patek Philippe watches. In particular, Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300A-010 currently holds the title of the most expensive watch (and wristwatch) ever sold at auction (US$31.19 million/31 million CHF), while Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication, the world\u2019s most complicated mechanical watch until 1989 currently holds the title of the most expensive pocket watch ever sold at auction",
            "detailed_content": "The company traces its origins to the mid-19th century, when Polish watchmaker Antoni Patek and his Czech-born Polish business partner Franciszek Czapek formed Patek, Czapek & Cie in Geneva on 1 May 1839 and started manufacturing pocket watches. The two eventually separated due to disagreements, and the company was liquidated on 18 April 1845. At that point, Czapek founded Czapek & Cie on 1 May 1845 with a new partner, Juliusz Gruzewski. Subsequently, Patek was joined by French watchmaker Adrien Philippe, the inventor of the keyless winding mechanism (although this had been discovered previously by Abraham Louis Breguet but not patented by him), and continued the watchmaking business with a new company, Patek & Cie, beginning on 15 May 1845.n 1 January 1851, the company\u2019s name was officially changed to Patek, Philippe & Cie. In the same year, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom acquired a keyless pendant watch at the Great Exhibition in London. The watch was embellished with rose-cut diamonds set in the pattern of a bouquet of flowers. The Queen had another exclusive Patek Philippe timepiece, to be worn pinned to clothing. This watch was suspended from a diamond and enamel brooch. In 1868, Patek Philippe created the first Swiss wristwatch for Countess Koscowicz of Hungary.In 1875, Adrien Philippe commissioned a watch that he later gave to his daughter Louise as a wedding present, which is known as the only wristwatch dating back to be owned by either Patek or Philippe. This historical watch is known as \u201cThe Watchmaker\u2019s Daughter\u201d and was auctioned in 2023 by the descendants of Adrien Philippe. The watch was purchased most probably by the Patek Philippe Museum though this is not confirmed and may be owned by a private collector. The wedding between Louise Philippe and Joseph Antoine B\u00e9nassy where the watch was presented is noted as the wedding that helped Patek Philippe survive the founding generation by providing the company with a successor to Antoni Patek1901 saw the transformation of Patek Philippe into a joint-stock company, Ancienne Manufacture d\u2019horlogerie Patek, Philippe & Cie, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme, initiated by J. A. B\u00e9nassy-Philippe and Joseph E. Philippe. Still being run as a family business, Patek Philippe then had seven shareholders, five of whom formed the board of directors with J. A. B\u00e9nassy-Philippe being the chairman. Joseph E. Philippe\u2019s son later joined the company, and he was the last offspring of the founders in the business In 1915, Albert Einstein ordered a gold pocket watch from Patek Philippe; in that year, he completed his Theory of General Relativity.The Stern family of Switzerland has owned Patek Philippe since 1932, when Charles Stern and Jean Stern acquired the company during the Great Depression. The Stern brothers\u2019 company, Fabrique de Cadrans Sterns Fr\u00e8res, had been a business partner of Patek Philippe as its supplier of watch dials. In 1935, Patek Philippe was brought to American markets by New York-based Henri Stern Watch Agency, where it was sold as a sister brand alongside Universal Gen\u00e8ve.Since the 2000s, Patek Philippe timepieces have repeatedly fetched high prices in auctions worldwide. As of 2023, among the world\u2019s top ten most expensive watches ever sold at auctions, nine are Patek Philippe watches. Among the top 58 most expensive watches sold at auction (over 2 million US dollars), 46 are Patek Philippe watches. A small part of the demand for auction pieces is driven by Patek Philippe themselves, as they are purchasing in the auction market to add to the collection of the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva.",

It specializes in leather goods, lifestyle accessories, home furnishings, perfumery, jewelry, watches and ready-to-wear. Since the 1950s, its logo has been a depiction of a ducal horse-drawn carriage.Thierry Herm\u00e8s was born in Krefeld, Germany, to a French father and a German mother. The family moved to France in 1828. In 1837, Herm\u00e8s first established a harness workshop in the Grands Boulevards quarter of Paris, dedicated to serving European noblemen. He created high-quality wrought harnesses and bridles for the carriage trade, winning several awards including the first prize in its class in 1855, and again in 1867, at the Expositions Universelles in Paris.Herm\u00e8s\u2019s son, Charles-\u00c9mile, took over management from his father in 1880, and moved the shop to 24 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9, where it remains. With the help of his sons Adolphe and \u00c9mile-Maurice, Charles-\u00c9mile introduced saddlery and started selling his products retail. The company catered to the \u00e9lite of Europe, North Africa, Russia, Asia, and the Americas. In 1900, the firm offered the Haut \u00e0 Courroies bag, specially designed for riders to carry their saddles with them.",
            "detailed_content": "After Charles-\u00c9mile Herm\u00e8s\u2019s retirement, sons Adolphe and \u00c9mile-Maurice took leadership and renamed the company Herm\u00e8s Fr\u00e8res. Shortly after, \u00c9mile-Maurice began furnishing the tsar of Russia with saddles. By 1914, up to 80 saddle craftsmen were employed. Subsequently, \u00c9mile-Maurice was granted the exclusive rights to use the zipper for leather goods and clothing, becoming the first to introduce the device in France. In 1918, Herm\u00e8s introduced the first leather golf jacket with a zipper, made for Edward, Prince of Wales. Because of its exclusive rights arrangement the zipper became known in France as the fermeture Herm\u00e8s (Herm\u00e8s fastener).Throughout the 1920s, when he was the sole head of the firm, \u00c9mile-Maurice added accessories and clothing collections. He also groomed his three sons-in-law (Robert Dumas, Jean-Ren\u00e9 Guerrand, and Francis Puech) as business partners. In 1922, the first leather handbags were introduced after \u00c9mile-Maurice\u2019s wife complained of not being able to find one to her liking. \u00c9mile-Maurice created the handbag collection himself.Post-\u00c9mile-Maurice Herm\u00e8s\u00a0Robert Dumas-Herm\u00e8s (1898\u20131978), who succeeded \u00c9mile-Maurice after his death in 1951, closely collaborated with brother-in-law Jean-Ren\u00e9 Guerrand. Dumas became the first man not directly descended from Herm\u00e8s p\u00e8re to lead the company because his connection to the family was only through marriage. Thus, he incorporated the Herm\u00e8s name into his own, Dumas-Herm\u00e8s.The company also acquired its Duc-carriage-with-horse logo and signature orange paper boxes in the early 1950s. Dumas introduced original handbags, jewelry, and accessories and was particularly interested in design possibilities with the silk scarves. During the mid-20th century, scarf production diminished. World Tempus, a Web portal dedicated to watchmaking, states: \u201cBrought to life by the magic wand of Annie Beaumel, the windows of the store on the [rue du] Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 became a theatre of enchantment and [established the store as] a Parisian meeting-place for international celebrities.\u201d In 1956, Life magazine featured a photograph of Grace Kelly, who had become the new Princess of Monaco, carrying the \u201cSac \u00e0 d\u00e9p\u00eaches\u201d bag. Purportedly, she held it in front of herself to disguise her pregnancy. Thus, when the public began calling it the \u201cKelly\u201d bag, a name subsequently adopted by Herm\u00e8s, it became hugely popular.The perfume business became a subsidiary in 1961, concurrently with the introduction of the \u201cCal\u00e8che\u201d scent, named after a hooded four-wheeled horse carriage, known since the 18th century, and is also the company\u2019s logo since the 1950s. In 2004, Jean-Claude Ellena became the in-house perfumer or \u201cnose\u201d and has created several successful scents, including the Hermessence line of fragrances.Beginnings in the 19th century",

Founded in 1905 as Wilsdorf and Davis by Hans Wilsdorf and Alfred Davis in London, the company registered Rolex as the brand name of its watches in 1908 and became Rolex Watch Co. Ltd. in 1915. After World War I, the company moved its base of operations to Geneva because of the unfavorable economy in the United Kingdom. In 1920, Hans Wilsdorf registered Montres Rolex SA in Geneva as the new company name (montre is French for clock or watch); it later became Rolex SA. Since 1960, the company has been owned by the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, a private family trust.Rolex SA and its subsidiary Montres Tudor SA design, make, distribute, and service wristwatches sold under the Rolex and Tudor brands. In 2023 Rolex agreed to acquire its longtime retail partner Bucherer.",
            "detailed_content": "Alfred Davis and his brother-in-law Hans Wilsdorf founded Wilsdorf and Davis, the company that would eventually become Rolex SA, in London in 1905. Wilsdorf and Davis\u2019s main commercial activity at the time involved importing Hermann Aegler\u2019s Swiss movements to England and placing them in watch cases made by Dennison and others. These early wristwatches were sold to many jewellers, who then put their own names on the dial. The earliest watches from Wilsdorf and Davis were usually hallmarked \u201cW&D\u201d inside the caseback.In 1908, Wilsdorf registered the trademark \u201cRolex\u201d, which became the brand name of watches from Wilsdorf and Davis. He opened an office in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Wilsdorf wanted the brand name to be easily pronounceable in any language, and short enough to fit on the face of a watch. He also thought that the name \u201cRolex\u201d was onomatopoeic, sounding like a watch being wound.In 1931, Rolex patented a self-winding mechanism called a Perpetual rotor, a semi-circular plate that relies on gravity to move freely. In turn, the Oyster watch became known as the Oyster Perpetual.Robert Dumas-Herm\u00e8s (1898\u20131978), who succeeded \u00c9mile-Maurice after his death in 1951, closely collaborated with brother-in-law Jean-Ren\u00e9 Guerrand. Dumas became the first man not directly descended from Herm\u00e8s p\u00e8re to lead the company because his connection to the family was only through marriage. Thus, he incorporated the Herm\u00e8s name into his own, Dumas-Herm\u00e8s.Rolex SA offers products under the Rolex and Tudor brands. Montres Tudor SA has designed, manufactured and marketed Tudor watches since 6 March 1946. Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf conceived Tudor to create a product for authorized Rolex dealers to sell that offered the reliability and dependability of a Rolex, but at a lower price. The number of Rolex watches was limited by the rate that they could produce in-house Rolex movements, thus Tudor watches were originally equipped with third-party standard movements supplied by ETA SA while using Rolex-quality cases and bracelets. Since 2015, Tudor has begun to manufacture watches with in-house movements. The first model introduced with an in-house movement was the Tudor North Flag. Following this, updated versions of the Tudor Pelagos and Tudor Heritage Black Bay have also been fitted with an in-house caliber.While Rolex mostly produces mechanical watches, it also participated in development of the original quartz watch movements. Although Rolex has made very few quartz models for its Oyster line, the company\u2019s engineers were instrumental in design and implementation of the technology during the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1968, Rolex collaborated with a consortium of 16 Swiss watch manufacturers to develop the Beta 21 quartz movement used in their Rolex Quartz Date 5100 alongside other manufactures including the Omega Electroquartz watches. Within about five years of research, design and development, Rolex created the \u201cclean-slate\u201d 5035/5055 movement that would eventually power the Rolex Oysterquartz",
